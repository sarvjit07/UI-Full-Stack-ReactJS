         JavaScript Fetch Promise
Issues with XMLHttpRequest:
- It is synchronous implicitly.
- You have to configure explicit asynchronous.
- It returns response in text format.
- Response in text is not safe, can be infected with virus.
- Explicit conversions are required.

          Solution:
- JavaScript E5+ version provides Promise function.
- Promise is async implicitly.
- It returns the data in binary format.
- It is easy to transport data in network.
- However it also requires explicit conversion.
- It is better in error handling.
